# 1. Introduction
This is a template for your weekly work. You can write text, include images, write equations, and include R code. The text below is provided just for demonstration, you can save it elsewhere and replace by your work.

> <font size="5">üí°</font> **Tip**
> 
> 1. You can rename the files in the project to something like `TimeSeriesWeek1.R` and `TimeSeriesWeek1.Rmd` and keep them in the `TimeSeriesWork` project folder.
> Or
> 2. You can also rename the folder to `TimeSeriesWeek1` and the project file to 
`TimeSeriesWeek1.Rproj` and keep one folder for each week
>
> <font size="5">‚ö†Ô∏è</font> **Warning** Do not use spaces in file names or folder names. They migh not cause problems today, but will some time in the future.

## 1.1 The first subsection
**There needs to be an empty line before a line starting with `#` or `##` otherwise section headings will not display properly.**

## 1.2 The second  subsection
You can write R code inline as follows `{r}x <- 1:10`. This is called *inline code*. You can also write code in a separate block as follows:

```{r}
# ENSO is a time series related to the 
# El Nino effect weather pattern in the South Pacific
# run ?astsa::ENSO for more information
library(astsa)
start(ENSO)
end(ENSO)
frequency(ENSO)
```
This is called a *code chunk*.

If you want to hide the code, just add `echo=FALSE` in the chunk options.
```{r echo=FALSE}
library(astsa)
start(ENSO)
end(ENSO)
frequency(ENSO)
```

## 1.3 Writing text
Text is written using the *markdown* syntax. Just Google this around. It is basically plain text but with some extras to make it look nice. 

- Sections start with a hash character `#`. 
- Subsections start with two hash characters `##`.
- etc.
- Boldface text is written with two asterisks `**like this**`.
- Italics text is written with one asterisk `*like this*`.
- Code is written in between  back-ticks \`like this\`.
- Codeblocks in R are written as 

\`\`\`{r}

\`\`\`
  
## 1.4 Callout blocks

> <font size="5">üìò</font> **Callout blocks**
> 
> You can typeset callout blocks 
> by writing text after the `>` character. 
> 
> You can also add emojis to make it look nice.

> <font size="5">‚ö†Ô∏è</font> **Important**
> 
> Your RMarkdown file should not include R instructions such as:
>
> - `install.packages("...")`, or
> - `help(...)` or `?...`,
> - `data()` or `data(package="...")`,
> - `View(...)`,
> - Or any other instruction that displays data in a separate window or requires user input.
> 
> as they are not suitable for an HTML document.
> 
> Run them in the console as part of your development. But not in the RMarkdown document.

# Section 2: This is the second section

## 2.1 Including image files
You can include images with `![](images/QMlogo.png)`

![](images/QMlogo.png)


## 2.2 Including hyperlinks
You can write an URL by surrounding it by `<` and `>`, this will render like this: <https://www.qmul.ac.uk>

You can also hyperlink text to a URL using `[text](url)`. 
For example:  `[Click here to go to the QMUL website](https://www.qmul.ac.uk)` results in 


[Click here to go to the QMUL website](https://www.qmul.ac.uk)


## 2.2 Displaying plots
You can also display plots. For example, the code below will display a plot of the ENSO data.
```{r}
plot(ENSO)
```

## 2.3 Writing equations
In the course we will not use this much, but in case you want, you can also write equations using $\LaTeX$. For example, the equation of a straight line is $y = mx + b$.
$$
z=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}}e^{-\frac{1}{2}x^2}
$$
etc.
